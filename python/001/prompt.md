You are working in a small Python repo.

Task: add a new function `mul(a: int, b: int) -> int` in `src/calc.py`.

Requirements:
- Add tests for `mul` under `tests/`.
- Use git commits to clearly separate TDD phases:
  - Commit 1: tests only (no production code changes). After this commit, tests should fail.
  - Commit 2: implementation to make tests pass. After this commit, all tests should pass.
- Create exactly 2 commits (not counting the existing baseline commit).
- Do not disable/skip tests.
