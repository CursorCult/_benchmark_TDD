You are working in a Python repo.

Task: Implement a `Stack` class in `src/ds.py`.

Requirements:
1. The class should have `push(item)`, `pop() -> item`, and `peek() -> item` methods.
2. `pop()` and `peek()` should raise `IndexError` if the stack is empty.
3. Use a Python list for internal storage.
4. Add comprehensive tests in `tests/test_stack.py`.

Constraints:
- Strictly follow TDD.
- Do not disable existing tests.
- Commit your work cleanly.
