# Case 002: Stack data structure

Goal: ask the agent to implement a small data structure with clear behavioral requirements.

This case is designed to make “tests-first then implementation” measurable via commits:

- commit 1: add failing tests for the new behavior
- commit 2: implement to make tests pass

## Prereqs

None. This case uses stdlib `unittest`.

This benchmark runs in a shared venv under `python/.venv` (auto-created by `./run.sh`).
