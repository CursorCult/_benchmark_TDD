You are working in a small Python repo.

Task: add a new function `mul(a: int, b: int) -> int` in `src/calc.py`.

Requirements:
- Add tests for `mul` under `tests/`.
- Commit your work with a clean, reviewable history.
- Do not disable/skip tests.

IMPORTANT: You must follow Test-Driven Development (TDD).
1. First, create a commit that ONLY adds the test (Red). This test must fail.
2. Next, create a commit that ONLY adds the implementation (Green). The tests must pass.
Do not combine tests and implementation in the same commit.
